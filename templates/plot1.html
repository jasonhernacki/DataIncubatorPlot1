<p>The above plot shows a clear decreasing trend in review lengths, especially after 2010. Posing an interesting question on the cause of such a steady change, this decrease can be tested for statistical significance using either event analysis or a difference sign test. To further check this decreasing trend, a longitudinal study was conducted compensating for an individual products reviews over time. I was able to find 147 products with reviews over than span of more than five years and ran a simple Kendall Tau test on each product for negative correlation where 114 of the 147 tests found significance at a 0.05 level. Given that the sample size for each test were near five and that under the null assumption only 8 tests would be expected to be significant, it is safe to conclude that even after accounting for a specific product, the review lengths appear to be shrinking over time. It should be noted that such a longitudinal test may be biased given that a products review lengths can naturally shrink overtime</p>

<p>On the other hand, using the AFINN sentiment database, a clear increasing trend can be seen after roughly 2010. Such results point to the fact that there is a clear relationship between time and reviews. Conducting the same longitudinal based study as for review lengths gave no significant results. There appeared to possibly be cyclic behavior however a turning point test offered no level of significance, which is not surprising given the sample sizes.<br></p>
